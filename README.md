Brief Task Description:
I have created a website using HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap which upon entering a locations tells its real time Weather conditions.
For fetching the real time weather conditions i have use weather API : OpenWeatherMap. In the Script i have used functions document.querySelector to fetch the details from the API and show it on the website. 
Further for the Frontend i have used CSS and also embeded Bootstrap. I have made a NavBar on the top with working buttons. 

The website is Responsive as well as I have used the Coloumn layout to Column 12 in each size of screen making it responsive.

There is also a welcome popup modal with instructions on how to use the Website. Also added a FavIcon for the website.
